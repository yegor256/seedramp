It knows where you#39;re eating, how often you check in, how much you#39;re spending, etc. Then, a restaurant across the street downloads another Privme app and literally says: quot;I will give 25% to everybody who is eating in this town frequently and is an active Facebook userquot;.

His burn rate is around $3,000 per month, which sounds very reasonable. He basically spends most of this money paying his own bills. That#39;s a perfect tactic for a young startup, I believe. He is planning to raise seed or series A money in a few months and needs cash to survive until then. He asked for $20,000 but I offered him $5,000 for the next calendar month.

I truly believe that taking lawyers out of the market as much as possible, and replacing them with computer systems, is definitely the right strategy./p pstrongTeam/strong. a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/danrubinsDan/a is a CEO, an architect and a programmer. I was glad to see that. In general, I believe in startups managed and founded by technical people, who are real authors of their products. There are a few freelancers helping him. That#39;s exactly the type of startup team I#39;m comfortable investing in./p pstrongCash/strong. Dan put his own money into this and someone else also added $25,000 a few months ago. His burn rate is around $3,000 per month, which sounds very reasonable. He basically spends most of this money paying his own bills. That#39;s a perfect tactic for a young startup, I believe. He is planning to raise seed or series A money in a few months and needs cash to survive until then. He asked for $20,000 but I offered him $5,000 for the next calendar month. If things go well, the product will be ready for a demo (it wasn#39;t during the interview) and beta-users will produce some traction. He may come back to us again and we#39;ll invest another portion of cash to cover the next calendar month./p pOn Monday, Dan emailed me the contract, we signed it electronically, and I#39;ve sent him a wire transfer for $5,000.
