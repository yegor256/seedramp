This was our 10th interview and I was very skeptical. To be honest, I even forgot about it, but Dan emailed me just a few hours before the appointment. It was a Saturday morning at 10am. I told Dan that previous interviews were not successful and he had to be ready for a negative answer. He said no problem, at least some feedback would be helpful. With that far from optimistic mood, we started.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div style=&#39;width:50%;float:right;z-index:100;margin-left:1em;&#39;&gt; &lt;div class=&#39;film&#39;&gt; &lt;iframe class=&#39;video&#39; src=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/embed/AetgrIGCrSU?controls=2&#39; allowfullscreen=&#39;&#39;&gt;&amp;#8203;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legalrobot.com&quot;&gt;LegalRobot&lt;/a&gt; is a hosted software solution for parsing legal documents and finding abnormalities within them. That&amp;#39;s how I understood it, at least. You can upload a PDF contract and in a few seconds get a summary of what looks suspicious. For example, &amp;quot;clause 8.3 is too much against the buyer.&amp;quot; The software contains a machine learning engine that basically compares a huge amount of similar documents with the one you uploaded. The smarter the engine, the more accurate the answers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market&lt;/strong&gt;. The product is already on the market, if Dan was telling the truth. There are a few beta-users already uploading some documents there and trying to use the system. Moreover, there are over 300 subscribers who expressed their interest in the system. I doubt that even 10% of them will become real clients, but it&amp;#39;s very important to see that Dan is focused on bringing his product to users.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competition&lt;/strong&gt;. There are a few companies that are technically doing the exact same thing. However, according to Dan, they are all focused on lawyers. Their target users are attorneys, while &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legalrobot.com&quot;&gt;LegalRobot&lt;/a&gt; is for those who want to do those verifications without paying legal fees. I truly believe that taking lawyers out of the market as much as possible, and replacing them with computer systems, is definitely the right strategy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/danrubins&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt; is a CEO, an architect and a programmer. I was glad to see that. In general, I believe in startups managed and founded by technical people, who are real authors of their products. There are a few freelancers helping him. That&amp;#39;s exactly the type of startup team I&amp;#39;m comfortable investing in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cash&lt;/strong&gt;. Dan put his own money into this and someone else also added $25,000 a few months ago. His burn rate is around $3,000 per month, which sounds very reasonable. He basically spends most of this money paying his own bills. That&amp;#39;s a perfect tactic for a young startup, I believe. He is planning to raise seed or series A money in a few months and needs cash to survive until then. He asked for $20,000 but I offered him $5,000 for the next calendar month. If things go well, the product will be ready for a demo (it wasn&amp;#39;t during the interview) and beta-users will produce some traction. He may come back to us again and we&amp;#39;ll invest another portion of cash to cover the next calendar month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Monday, Dan emailed me the contract, we signed it electronically, and I&amp;#39;ve sent him a wire transfer for $5,000.
